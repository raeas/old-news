### Summary
The "Old News" app uses the Library of Congress' API and Google Maps JavaScript API. Users can do a key word search of the "Chronicling America" digital newspaper archive. The search results display the title of the newspaper, an image of the newspaper where the keyword is found, the publication date, and a link to the Library of Congress record for the item. Once the search results are returned from the Library of Congress API, the Google Maps JavaScript API plots the location of the newspaper on a map. The concept is to show geographical trends of search terms/article topics. Event listeners are set up so that, once the markers are plotted on the map, users can click to a readable place name (typically city, state).
